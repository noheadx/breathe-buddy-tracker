The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### First Time Setup

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up with your email and password
2. **Set Your Threshold**: Configure your personal peak flow threshold in Settings
3. **Start Logging**: Begin recording your daily peak flow readings

### Logging Readings

1. Enter your peak flow value in the input field
2. Click "Add Reading" to save
3. The reading is automatically timestamped and saved to your account

### Viewing Statistics

- **Today's Readings**: See all measurements taken today
- **Recent Readings**: View your latest entries with date and time
- **Average Tiles**: Monitor trends across different time periods
  - Averages only appear once sufficient data is collected
  - Each tile shows remaining days needed for calculation

### Managing Settings

## Database Schema

The app uses three main tables:

- **peak_flow_entries**: Stores individual readings with timestamp and value
- **user_settings**: Manages user preferences and threshold values
- **profiles**: Contains user profile information

All tables are protected with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data privacy.
