```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### First Time Setup

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up with your email and password
2. **Set Your Threshold**: Configure your personal peak flow threshold in Settings
3. **Start Logging**: Begin recording your daily peak flow readings

### Password Recovery

If you forget your password:

1. Click "Forgot password?" on the login page
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for a 6-digit verification code
4. Enter the code and set your new password
5. The code expires in 15 minutes for security

### Logging Readings

1. Enter your peak flow value in the input field
2. Click "Add Reading" to save
3. The reading is automatically timestamped and saved to your account

### Viewing Statistics

- **Today's Readings**: See all measurements taken today
- **Recent Readings**: View your latest entries with date and time
- **Average Tiles**: Monitor trends across different time periods
  - Averages only appear once sufficient data is collected
  - Each tile shows remaining days needed for calculation

### Managing Settings

Click the Settings icon to:
- Adjust your threshold value

## Database Schema

The app uses four main tables:

- **peak_flow_entries**: Stores individual readings with timestamp and value
- **user_settings**: Manages user preferences and threshold values
- **profiles**: Contains user profile information
- **password_reset_codes**: Securely stores password reset verification codes with expiration

All tables are protected with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data privacy.

## Backend Functions

The app includes serverless edge functions for:

- **send-reset-code**: Generates and emails 6-digit password reset codes
- **verify-reset-code**: Validates reset codes and updates user passwords

These functions use Resend for reliable email delivery from noreply@9oaks.app.
